When testing code that interacts with complex external components—such as third-party libraries or network services—we often face challenges that make testing difficult.

Consider testing a function that fetches data from an external server and stores it in a database. This scenario introduces several testing concerns:

- **Performance issues**: Tests may run slowly due to network communication and database operations
- **Reliability problems**: Tests might be flaky because of random network failures or data conflicts when tests run in different orders

Test doubles offer a solution to these challenges by replacing production components with simplified versions during testing.

## What Are Test Doubles?

Test doubles replace one or more production software components with alternative implementations specifically designed for testing. When writing tests, we focus on the "system under test" (SUT)--the specific component being evaluated. Test doubles stand in for other components (called "collaborators" or "depended-on components" or DOCs) that interact with the SUT but aren't the focus of testing.

The key characteristic of test doubles is that **they provide the same API as the real components they replace**. From the SUT's perspective, a test double behaves identically to the real component.

### Practical Example

In our example of testing a function that makes network requests and stores data in a database:

- The function itself is the *system under test (SUT)*
- The external server and database are *collaborators*

Since we're testing the function and not the collaborators, we could:

- Replace the network call with a test double that simulates server responses without actual network communication
- Substitute a "fake" in-memory database implementation instead of using a real database

This approach gives us greater control over interactions between the function and its collaborators, allowing tests to focus specifically on the function's behavior.

### Benefits of Test Doubles

Test doubles offer several key advantages:

- **Predictability**: Their behavior is controlled by test implementers
- **Speed**: Tests run faster by avoiding slow operations like network calls
- **Focus**: They help isolate the specific component being tested

In the following sections, we'll explore the different types of test doubles and how to incorporate them into your testing strategy.

## Types of Test Doubles

Test doubles are essential components in the testing toolkit that replace production dependencies during testing. Below are the main categories of test doubles, each serving distinct testing purposes.

### Stubbing: Controlling Indirect Inputs

A [**stub**](http://xunitpatterns.com/Test%20Stub.html) is a test-specific implementation that provides predefined responses to calls made by the system under test (SUT).

You should use stubs when:

- you need to control indirect inputs that aren't passed directly to the SUT
- testing specific behaviors that depend on particular input conditions

> Consider a function that generates HTML to display the current time, with special formatting for noon (12:00 pm). Since you can't easily test this at precisely noon every day, you could use a stub to replace the system clock and provide a fixed time value of 12:00 pm.

### Spying: Observing Indirect Outputs

A [**spy**](http://xunitpatterns.com/Test%20Spy.html) records calls made to it by the SUT and captures the parameter values, allowing you to verify these indirect outputs in your tests.

You should use spies when:

- you need to validate side effects that occur when the SUT interacts with its environment
- you want to prevent actual side effects while still verifying they were attempted

> In a flight management system, when testing a flight cancellation function, you might want to verify that email notifications would be sent to all passengers without actually sending emails. A spy could record these attempted notifications while preventing actual emails from being sent.

### Faking: Lightweight Alternative Implementations

A [**fake**](http://xunitpatterns.com/Fake%20Object.html) is a simplified yet functional implementation of a component that the SUT depends on.

You should use fakes when:

- interactions with the real component would be costly or slow
- you want to avoid undesirable side effects during testing

> Instead of connecting to a production database during tests, you might implement a fake in-memory database using hash tables. This allows the SUT to perform all its normal database operations without the overhead or side effects of using the real database.

### Dummy Objects: Fulfilling Parameter Requirements

A [**dummy object**](http://xunitpatterns.com/Dummy%20Object.html) satisfies the API requirements of the SUT without providing any real functionality.

You should use dummy objects when:

- the SUT requires inputs that won't affect the test outcome
- these inputs are complex or time-consuming to create

> If you're testing an Invoice class's ability to add line items, but the Invoice constructor requires a Customer object (which requires an Address, which requires a City, etc.), you could use a dummy Customer object with minimal or null internal values just to satisfy the constructor requirements.

### A Note on "Mocking"

The term "mock" has varied meanings in testing literature:

- Some authors (like [Meszaros](http://xunitpatterns.com/Mock%20Object.html) and [Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html)) use "mock" specifically for test doubles that perform assertions internally.
- Others (like [Software Engineering at Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch13.html#mocking_frameworks), [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/but-really-what-is-a-javascript-mock), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/mock-functions), and [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/mocking)) use "mock" more broadly for any test double defined inline in a test.

In this latter context, a mock could be a stub, spy, or hybrid that both injects inputs and records outputs. "Mocking" refers to the act of replacing real components with these test doubles.
