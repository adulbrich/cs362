For the final project in this course, you will work in teams to write tests for an application and set up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically test and deploy that application. 

## Team Size

- Standard team size: **4 students**
- Exception: One team might have 3 or 5 members depending on class size

## Forming Your Team

You have two options to form your team.

### Option 1: Choose Your Own Team

Connect with classmates in class or through:

- Canvas Discussions
- Microsoft Teams
- Discord

If your team has fewer than 4 members, please try to find additional teammates. The instructor will fill in any gaps with students who are not on a team.

### Option 2: Random Assignment

Complete the form in the Canvas assignment by the specified deadline (this is NOT the assignment deadline).

This form is optional and allows you to indicate:

- Your availabilities to meet
- Expertise with JavaScript
- Any special requests

*The instructor will attempt to accommodate preferences, starting with special requests, but cannot guarantee all requests will be met.*

## Registering Your Team

Once your team is formed:

1. Go to the "People" section in Canvas
2. Navigate to the "Project Teams" tab
3. Select an unused "Project Team" group
4. The first person to join will be designated as the team "leader"
5. The leader can add manage team members

Once the deadline for team formation has passed, teams cannot be changed. If you have a special circumstance, please contact the instructor.
