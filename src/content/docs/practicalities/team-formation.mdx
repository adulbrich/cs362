For the final project in this course, you will work in teams to write tests for an application and set up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically test and deploy that application. 

You should form a team of **up to four people** from this class to work with on the final project.

Ideally, your team should have three or four people, so each team member has a reasonable amount of work to do for the project. You cannot have a team of one.

You may choose your own team. 

If you don't have a final project team, you can reach out to your classmates through Canvas Discussions, Microsoft Teams, or Discord.

If you already have a team with fewer than four members, we encourage you to find one more.

Alternatively, if you'd like to be randomly assigned to a team of 3-4 members for the final project, please complete the form in the Canvas assignment by the specified deadline (NOT the assignment deadline).

Once you have your final project team formed, go to Canvas and add all of your team members to one of the pre-created teams there called "Project Teams". 

You can find these teams by going to the "People" section of the Canvas course and navigating to the "Project Teams" tab. You'll see several groups starting with "Project Team". You can choose an unused one of these teams. If you're the first person to sign up for a team, you'll be assigned as the team "leader" so you're able to manage the team's membership and add your teammates.
