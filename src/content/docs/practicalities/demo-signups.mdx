Most assignments and the final project require an in-person demo.  The demo is an opportunity for you to show your work to the instructor and TAs, and to ask any questions you may have about the assignment or project. The demo is also a chance for the instructor and TAs to provide feedback on your work.

Part of your grade for most assignments and the final project will be based on your performance during the demo. This includes your ability to explain your work, answer questions, and demonstrate your understanding of the material.

## Assignments

Only three out of the four assignments will require a demo. The assignments that require a demo are:

- Unit Tests
- Integration Tests
- End-to-End Tests

You have to sign up for one appointment per assignment.

You can use the Bookings link in the Canvas assignment to sign up for each demo. 

The demo appointments are scheduled for 10 minutes each. Come to your demos prepared to run your tests from your computer.
