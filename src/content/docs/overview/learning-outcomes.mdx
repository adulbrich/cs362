At the end of the course, you will be able to:

1. Apply testing techniques, including black-box and white-box techniques, automatic testing activities, and regression testing
2. Apply automated tools such as make and CVS in a realistic setting
3. Describe the cost-benefit trade-offs inherent in the use of automated tools for building software and configuration management
4. Describe several techniques for validating and measuring the quality of software
5. Use appropriate techniques and tools, including a debugger, to locate program faults
6. Describe several types of maintenance processes associated with correcting and enhancing software systems
7. Participate effectively in a software inspection
8. Participate effectively in a team environment

These are the official course learning outcomes as of Spring 2025.

In practice, you will be able to:

- Use a modern version control system to maintain the version history of a software project
- Understand modern best practices for automated software testing
- Use a testing framework and an assertion library to implement automated software tests
- Design and implement effective unit tests
- Understand when it is appropriate to use test doubles, such as mocks
- Use test doubles effectively within software tests
- Design and implement effective integration tests
- Design and implement effective end-to-end tests
- Use a modern continuous integration and continuous deployment platform to automatically build, test, and deploy a software project
- Employ effective strategies and workflows for collaborating with other software developers on a software project
- Practice effective code review

{/* Notes:
  - Use debugging tools effectively to identify, isolate, and fix software defects in various environments (browser dev tools, IDE debuggers, logging)
  - Evaluate the cost-benefit tradeoffs of different testing strategies and tools to make informed decisions about test coverage and automation
  - Apply software maintenance best practices to refactor, update, and extend existing codebases while preserving functionality
