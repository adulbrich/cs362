At the end of the course, you will be able to:

1. Apply testing techniques, including black-box and white-box techniques, automatic testing activities, and regression testing
2. Apply automated tools such as make and CVS in a realistic setting
3. Describe the cost-benefit trade-offs inherent in the use of automated tools for building software and configuration management
4. Describe several techniques for validating and measuring the quality of software
5. Use appropriate techniques and tools, including a debugger, to locate program faults
6. Describe several types of maintenance processes associated with correcting and enhancing software systems
7. Participate effectively in a software inspection
8. Participate effectively in a team environment

These are the official course learning outcomes as of Spring 2025.

{/* In practice, you will be able to:

- Apply advanced testing techniques, including black-box and white-box methodologies, automated testing processes, and regression testing, to ensure robust and reliable software systems.
- Utilize modern automation tools, such as Docker, Git/GitHub, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, within practical, real-world contexts to streamline development and deployment workflows.
- Assess the cost-benefit trade-offs associated with implementing automated tools for software construction and configuration management, making informed decisions to optimize efficiency and resource allocation.
- Describe contemporary techniques for validating and measuring software quality, including observability practices, chaos engineering principles, and AI-enhanced metrics, to uphold high standards in system performance and reliability.
- Employ sophisticated tools and techniques, such as integrated development environment (IDE) profilers and distributed tracing, to identify and resolve program faults with precision and efficiency.
- Explain current maintenance processes for software systems, encompassing corrective actions, feature enhancements, and the management of technical debt, to sustain long-term system integrity and adaptability.
- Contribute effectively to software inspections, demonstrating analytical rigor and collaborative skill to enhance code quality and ensure compliance with project specifications.
- Perform proficiently in team settings, engaging with agile methodologies, distributed teams, and emerging collaborative technologies to deliver cohesive and innovative software solutions. */}
