In this assignment, you will utilize tools explored in class to implement integration tests for small UI-based applications. You will write tests for two distinct applications, with specific testing goals for each, as detailed below. Clone your GitHub Classroom repository for this assignment (available on Canvas) to get started.

Before you begin writing tests, set up your testing environment. `vitest` and `http-server` are already included as dependencies in `package.json`. Install it by running:

```shell
npm install
```

To effectively test the HTML/JS-based applications in this assignment, you'll need additional tools and libraries. Ensure you install the following:

- The [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) library for creating a virtual DOM environment. You need to setup the [vitest jsdom environment](https://vitest.dev/guide/environment.html#jsdom).
- The [@testing-library/dom](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library) library for locating UI elements as a user would.
- The [@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom) library for extending Vitest's expect function with DOM-specific matchers.
- The [@testing-library/user-event](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event) library for simulating user interactions with the apps.
- The [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/) (MSW) for mocking responses from web API data requests.

Don't forget to:

- check the **grading rubric** in the Canvas assignment, 
- submit a link to your GitHub Classroom repository in the Canvas assignment, and
- attend your **assignment demo**, which you should have already scheduled at this point.

The assignment is divided into the following parts:

## Testing a User Registration Form

Located in the `registerUser/` directory of this repository is a simple user registration form application. In this application, users enter an email address and password to register for a new account. Upon clicking the "register" button, the entered email address and password are validated. The application responds as follows:

- If both the email and password are valid, a success message appears, and the form fields are cleared.
- If either the email address or the password is invalid, an error message is displayed. Specifically, if the password is invalid, the error message will detail the reasons for its invalidity.

You can interact with this application by running:

```shell
npm run serve:register
```

Your task for this section is to create integration tests using the tools discussed in class. The test design is up to you, but at a minimum, your tests should include test cases for each behavior shown in the **videos available in the repository**. Include multiple tests to cover different aspects of a single behavior when necessary (e.g., ensuring the error message adapts correctly to different failure types). See below for additional requirements.

## Testing a Roman Numeral Converter Application

The `romanNumerals/` directory in this repository contains an application that converts Arabic numbers to Roman numerals. The application features a number input field for entering Arabic numbers and supports conversion to both "old" and "modern" Roman numerals. The application functions as follows:

- The "old" Roman numeral conversion updates live as the user types, using the `convertToOldRoman()` function in `romanNumerals.js`.
- The "modern" Roman numeral conversion is triggered when the user clicks the "Convert to 'Modern' Roman Numerals" button. This action sends the Arabic number to a web API, which responds with the corresponding "modern" Roman numeral. Refer to the "submit" event listener in `romanNumerals.js` for implementation details.
- If the user modifies the entered number after converting to "modern" Roman, the "modern" Roman numeral is cleared.

You can interact with this application by running:

```shell
npm run serve:numerals
```

Your task for this section is to develop integration tests using the tools covered in class. You are responsible for designing the tests, but they should, at a minimum, accomplish the following (see below for additional requirements):

- Include one or more test cases for each behavior demonstrated in the **videos available in the repository**.
- To prevent instability, mock the web API used for the "modern" Roman numeral conversion. More information about this API can be found here: https://helloacm.com/tools/romans/. Experimenting with the API will help you understand its behavior and responses, enabling you to effectively mock them in your tests.
- You **do not** need to implement tests for **error cases** in this application.

## Additional Requirements For This Assignment's Tests

In addition to the application-specific requirements outlined above, your tests should meet these general criteria:

- Verify that the application's user interface responds correctly to various user interactions. This may involve testing for the appearance or disappearance of UI elements or other UI modifications.
- Use the tools studied in class to interact with the application as an end-user would.
- Each test should concentrate on a single behavior (e.g., "the form fields are cleared when the email and password are both valid"). Avoid overloading individual tests.
