In this assignment, you will use Playwright to write end-to-end tests for a Roman numeral calculator application. 

Begin by installing the dependencies listed in `package.json` by running:

```shell
npm install
```

You'll also need to install and set up [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

Don't forget to:

- check the **grading rubric** in the Canvas assignment, and
- attend your **assignment demo**, which you should have already scheduled at this point.

This calculator functions like a standard pocket calculator, enabling you to perform simple arithmetic operations. However, unlike most calculators, this one displays numbers exclusively in Roman numerals (plus "0").

The application itself is located in the `calculator/` directory. Instructions for running it are included in the section below. I recommend starting by running the application and experimenting with it to familiarize yourself with its functionality:

```shell
npm run serve
```

You must use Playwright to test the application flows described below. 

{/* TODO: record videos of each functionality */}

## Simple Calculation and Conversion

Write a Playwright test that performs a basic calculation and verifies the accuracy of the results. This test should be conducted entirely on the app's home page (i.e., the URL path `/`). This test should be performed *before* registering a user.

## Calculation and Conversion to "modern" Roman

Write a Playwright test that performs a calculation in "old" Roman numeral mode (the default) and then clicks the "mdrn" button to convert to "modern" Roman numerals. This test will utilize the same web API that we used in assignment 3 to perform the conversion to "modern" Roman numerals. In an end-to-end test, we don't want to mock this service as we did for our integration tests. This test should take place completely on the app's home page (i.e., the URL path `/`).

## User Registration

Write a Playwright test that starts on the app's home page (i.e., the URL path `/`) and registers a new user by clicking on the "Register" link at the top of the app, typing a valid email address and password into the registration form, and then clicking the "Register" button. If registration is successful, the app will display a success message then automatically redirect you back to the app's home page. In your test, assert that the success message appears and that the redirect takes place to verify that registration was successful.

## User Login

Write a separate Playwright test that logs a user into the app. Because Playwright isolates tests by default, the user that was registered previously will no longer exist, so you'll have to begin the test by registering a user, starting at the app's home page (i.e., the URL path `/`). You do not have to make assertions to verify that registration succeeded in this test.

After the user is registered, proceed by clicking on the "Login" link at the top of the app, and then submitting the same credentials you provided during the registration step. If login is successful, the app will automatically redirect you back to the app's home page, where the navigation bar should be updated to contain three links ("History", "Logout", and "Unregister"). In your test, assert that the redirect takes place and that the navbar is updated to verify that login was successful.

## Calculation History

Write a separate Playwright test that verifies that a logged-in user's calculation history is successfully recorded. Specifically, once a user is logged in, each calculation they make will be recorded every time they click the "=" key, and that history can be viewed on the app's "History" page.

Because Playwright isolates tests by default, the user that was previously registered and logged in will no longer exist, so you'll have to begin the test by registering a user and then logging that user in, starting at the app's home page (i.e., the URL path `/`). You do not have to make assertions to verify that registration or login succeeded in this test.

Then, verify that the user's calculation history is correctly recorded by performing a few calculations (making sure to hit the "=" key a few times) and then clicking the "History" link in the navbar. The test should make assertions on the "History" page to verify that the history displayed there correctly represents the calculations performed.

## Logout

Write a separate Playwright test that verifies that a logged-in user can successfully logout. Because Playwright isolates tests by default, the user that was previously registered and logged in will no longer exist, so you'll have to begin the test by registering a user and then logging that user in, starting at the app's home page (i.e., the URL path `/`). You do not have to make assertions to verify that registration or login succeeded in this test.

Then, verify that the logout functionality works correctly by clicking the "Logout" link in the navbar. This will logout the user and the navigation bar should be updated to contain only the "Login" and "Register" links. Write assertions to verify that this happens correctly.

## Test Requirements

The tests you write for this assignment should satisfy the following requirements:

- As always, we want to avoid incorporating implementation details into our tests to the extent possible.
- We want end-to-end tests to match a real execution environment as much as possible. For this reason, you should *not* use doubles in any of the tests for this assignment.
- Your tests should assume the application server is already started. Make sure the server is running before starting your tests.

{/* ## Running the application and tests for this assignment

**⛔️⛔️⛔️Playwright DOES NOT run on the ENGR servers, so you will need to run tests somewhere else for this assignment!!⛔️⛔️⛔️** I'd strongly developing and running tests on your local machine (e.g. directly on your laptop or desktop) for this assignment. However, I've also set up GitHub Codespaces for this assignment, and you can use a Codespace for your runtime environment if you'd like. See below for details on how to set up and use a Codespace for this assignment.

Here are a few other tips about running the application and tests for this assignment:

  * Playwright works best when the application code being tested is being run on a server, so the application for this assignment is set up to be served instead of opening HTML files directly in your browser. You can start the application server using the command `npm start`. When the application server is running, it will print out a URL you can use to visit the app in your browser (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`).

  * In class, we will use the command `npx playwright test` to run Playwright tests. Because Playwright is a graphical application, you won't be able to use `npx playwright test` if you're working in a GitHub Codespace. Instead, you'll have to manually set up your tests (e.g. creating `playwright.config.js` and the `tests/` directory yourself, following the examples from lecture) and use the command `npx playwright test --headless` to run them in "headless" mode, which will run the tests without opening any GUI windows. */}

{/* ## Running code in GitHub Codespaces

For this assignment, I've enabled a feature called [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/) that will provide you with a private online environment where you can develop and test your code for the assignment. This environment will be centered around a browser-based version of the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor. You can access the Codespace by clicking "Create codespace on main" under the "Code" button in your assignment repository on GitHub:

![Image of GitHub Codespaces button](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wvijvh130fjuud5/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-24%20at%2011.17.58%20AM.png?raw=true)

You may use this browser-based editor as much or as little as you like, and in general, I encourage you to stick with whatever development setup already works best for you (i.e. your preferred editor running on your preferred development machine).

The reason I'm providing the Codespace is to provide an environment where you can run Playwright if you're not comfortable running on your local machine. To be able to use Playwright in the this Codespace, you'll need to make sure its dependencies are installed in the Codespace. You can do this by running the following two commands in the Codespace terminal:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get --yes install libgtk2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libgbm-dev  \
    libnotify-dev libgconf-2-4 libnss3 libxss1 libasound2     \
    libxtst6 xauth xvfb
```
Note that during the course of the execution of these two commands, you will be prompted with some questions you'll need to answer.

You'll also need to make sure a browser is installed in the Codespace for Playwright to use to run its tests. For example, you can install Firefox like this after running the two commands above:
```
sudo apt-get --yes install firefox
```

You can access the Codespace terminal through the menu of the browser-based version of VS Code associated with the Codespace:

![Image of Codespace terminal access](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nqebudssjvcwyw5/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-24%20at%2011.45.34%20AM.png?raw=true)

Inside this terminal, you should be able to run your code as described above.

If you're editing outside the browser-based version of VS Code associated with your Codespace, and you want to test your code inside the Codespace, you'll need to make sure you use Git to pull your most recent commit(s) into the Codespace. You can do this through the browser-based VS Code's Git integration:

![Image of VS Code Git pull command](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d4rlv954af0q6r4/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-24%20at%2011.37.23%20AM.png?raw=true) */}
